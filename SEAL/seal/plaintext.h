    /**
    Class to store a plaintext element. The data for the plaintext is
    a polynomial with coefficients modulo the plaintext modulus. The degree
    of the plaintext polynomial must be one less than the degree of the
    polynomial modulus. The backing array always allocates one 64-bit word
    per each coefficient of the polynomial.

    @par Memory Management
    The coefficient count of a plaintext refers to the number of word-size
    coefficients in the plaintext, whereas its capacity refers to the number 
    of word-size coefficients that fit in the current memory allocation. In 
    high-performance applications unnecessary re-allocations should be avoided 
    by reserving enough memory for the plaintext to begin with either by 
    providing the desired capacity to the constructor as an extra argument, or 
    by calling the reserve function at any time. 
    
    When the scheme is scheme_type::BFV each coefficient of a plaintext is 
    a 64-bit word, but when the scheme is scheme_type::CKKS the plaintext is
    by default stored in an NTT transformed form with respect to each of the
    primes in the coefficient modulus. Thus, the size of the allocation that
    is needed is the size of the coefficient modulus (number of primes) times
    the degree of the polynomial modulus. In addition, a valid CKKS plaintext
    will also store the parms_id for the corresponding encryption parameters.

    @par Thread Safety
    In general, reading from plaintext is thread-safe as long as no other
    thread is concurrently mutating it. This is due to the underlying data
    structure storing the plaintext not being thread-safe.

    @see Ciphertext for the class that stores ciphertexts.
